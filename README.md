[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) is a battle-tested tool for composing code blocks into build pipelines; [Singer](https://www.singer.io/) is a popular open-source ETL framework. [gulpetl](https://gulpetl.com) brings them together into a powerful and accessible framework allowing small single-purpose gulp and gulpetl plugins to be assembled into flexible and highly customized data pipelines.

Starting with the included Node-RED core nodes, you can now build those same pipelines in the visual, low-code world of Node-RED!

Check out our [main page](https://gulpetl.com), and then head over to [the docs](https://docs.gulpetl.com) to get started.
